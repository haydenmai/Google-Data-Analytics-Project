# Welcome!
I am Hayden Mai, a student at Simon Fraser University. I am currently studying Economics with a side of Computing Science. 

This is a place I will be sharing my personal and school projects! It is pretty empty right now... but I have a few projects in the works. I will also upload any old projects here for record keeping and see my own progress.

## Work in progress. Come back soon!
